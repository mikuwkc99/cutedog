<h1>Tips For Bringing Home Your New Puppy</h1>
<p> <b>What to bring when you go to pick up your new puppy</b>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Any necessary registration papers filled out in advance to save time.</li>
<li>A small blanket that the puppy can nestle into to feel more comfortable. (After meeting the breeder, you may want to leave this towel with the puppy’s litter or mother for a while so that it will bear a more familiar and comforting scent).</li>
<li>A leash and small collar with an ID tag attached containing your name, number and the puppy’s name.</li>
<li>A little snack and some water in a travel-friendly bowl so that puppy does not go hungry or thirsty in the car, especially if it’s a long drive.</li>
<li>A towel or paper towels in case they are carsick or soil themselves.</li>
<li>A puppy-safe chew toy (such as a Kong) to keep them busy during the ride home.</li>
<li>A crate or dog carrier that the puppy can rest in if they are tired or overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
